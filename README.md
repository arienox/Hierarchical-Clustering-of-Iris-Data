# Hierarchical-Clustering-of-Iris-Data
This code performs hierarchical clustering on the Iris dataset, using the Agglomerative Clustering method to group the data into 3 clusters. It also generates a dendrogram plot to help determine the optimal number of clusters and plots the resulting clusters using different colors.
